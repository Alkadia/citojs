# cito.js

cito.js is a JavaScript framework for building fast and modularized web applications (work in progress).
The core consists of a virtual DOM library inspired by React/Mithril with support for partial updates and events.
On top of that, it will provide an abstraction layer which will make it very easy to define and reuse components.
